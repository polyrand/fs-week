To run the sagemaker notebook you need to have your AWS cli
configured in your computer.

Inside that notebook we use a folder called `modelcom/`.
This folder should be in the same folder as the notebook, but now
it's in the `../models` folder. You can either change the route
in the notebook or move the folder here.

You also need to create an S3 bucket in AWS and change the name
of the bucket used in the notebook.
