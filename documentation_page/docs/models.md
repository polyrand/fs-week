## Model description

This model is a binar classifier. It will classify between **ants** and **bees**. The training data includes 10 images of each class for training and 2 images of each class for validation #bigdata.

Jokes apart, this is done on purpose to make it easier to experiment. Once you feel confortable with your workflow, you can try with bigger datasets. Remeber to change the model if you need to! (mostly the last fully-connected layer)

## Remember to always start with good baselines

For example. In computer vision a resnet18 is a good starting point. In text classification an LSTM may be a good starting point.
